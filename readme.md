# This is a test title for Homework 6

## IS - 601

This is a test for the readme file.

## Note for Professor Williams

The .env file is included in the .gitignore file and was not updated to the repo. The structure of the file is the same as seen in the video, and it passed all the tests. The reason for this note is that the instructions were incomplete in the Submission Requirements of the repo: log_and_environment, and I wasn't sure if the .env file should be updated for grading purposes.

Thank you,  
Carlos Vanegas.
